# Pico-6502-V3
NEO6502 startup

this is my initial take of getting the neo6502 memory emulator functionality working

09/07/2023 added a simple soundgenerator as experiment

10/07/2023 cleanup of keyboard processing

11/07/2023 BRK handler added (will display content of registers)

12/07/2023 Prepping for dynamic ROM loading mechanism & moved RESET(40) ==> UEXT.3 to free up SPI
